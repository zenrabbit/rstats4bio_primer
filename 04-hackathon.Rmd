All models are wrong but some are useful [@RN6467; @RN7258]. Critical thinking with statistics is thus critical to ensure that we effectively support evidence informed decision making in society [@RN6861; @RN7180].    

#### Learning outcomes {-}  
1. Appreciate the challenge of working with data to apply a critical thinking & creative design mindset to statistical solutions.  
2. Practice your workflow and literate coding before a summative test.   
3. Refine your thinking and coding for efficiency.    

#### Critical thinking {-}  
[Efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency_(statistics)) is a fascinating topic in statistics [@RN7261; @RN7260; @RN7259]. Here, we can simplify this using the critical thinking criteria we have extensively refined and applied to numerous, tidy challenges. Efficiency = sufficiency (provided it is logical, fair, and accurate). Your plots and statistical models should represent a reasonable and likely description of the data at hand. This section is a formative opportunity for you to evaluate your skills and strengths in logic, efficiency, fair adventuring, workflows, and literate coding prior to the final section - a test. You are provided with a general dataset(s). The adventure is solve a very generalized challenge that is embodied in the evidence.    

#### Adventure time {-}  
Candy. Candy. Candy. Take a peek at these sweet data. Contrast Canada and USA candy sales at Halloween. Considering including population density in your model for each country for each year so as not to introduce variation and to be more accurate in estimating meaningful differences.

[USA Candy & Halloween spending](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/USA_Halloween_spending/13125572)  
[Human populations](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/World_human_populations/16746652)  

Deeper dive: contrast GLMM model performance, examine temporal effects, or explore GAMs.

```{r include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
Canada <- read_csv(url("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/30990820"))
Canada

USA <- read_csv(url("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/25190510"))
USA

humans <- read_csv(url("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/30993373"))
humans

```

#### Reflection questions {-}  
1. How does veracity of data from different resources potentially influence your critical thinking?  
2. Can joining data introduce errors?
3. How does the available data bias the inference and interpretation of relative variables on key outcomes?  

### Book review {-}  

#### Instructions {-}  
- Read the key chapters that best support your learning from the text 'The New Statistics with R' [@RN6087].  
- Please use the [ten simple rules for reviews](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006562) [@RN6148] as your instructions how to do a review.  
- Write and submit a short, less than 2000 word review of this text and submit to [turnitin.com](https://www.turnitin.com).
