[["hackathon.html", "Chapter 5 Hackathon", " Chapter 5 Hackathon All models are wrong but some are useful (Stouffer 2019; Box 1976). Critical thinking with statistics is thus critical to ensure that we best support evidence informed decision making in society (Lortie and Owen 2020; Neelen and Kirschner 2020). Learning outcomes Appreciate the challenge of working with data to apply a critical design mindset to statistical solutions. Practice your workflow and literate coding. Refine your thinking and coding for efficiency. Critical thinking Efficiency is a fascinating topic in statistics (Craycraft 1999; Kenett, Coleman, and Stewardson 2003; Norman 2003). Here, we can simplify this using the critical thinking criteria we have extensively refined and applied to numerous, tidy challenges. Efficiency = sufficiency (provided it is logical, fair, and accurate). Your plots and statistical models should represent a reasonable and likely description of the data at hand. This section is a formative opportunity for you to evaluate your skills and strengths in logic, efficiency, fair adventuring, workflows, and literate coding prior to the final section - a test. You are provided with a general dataset(s). The adventure is solve a very generalized challenge that is embodied in the evidence.

Are there ways to mitigate bias and p-hacking through formal workflows? Did building a model such as GLM align with critical thinking and intuition, i.e from critical thinking was it accurate and fair? Did the EDA-to-model process legitimately represent the patterns in the observations recorded. "]]
